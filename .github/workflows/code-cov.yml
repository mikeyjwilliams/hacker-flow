# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell

    - name: Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1.0.6
      with:
        # User defined upload name. Visible in Codecov UI
        name: michael williams
        # Repository upload token - get it from codecov.io. Required only for private repositories
        token: # optional
        # Path to coverage file to upload
        file: # optional
        # Flag upload to group coverage metrics (e.g. unittests | integration | ui,chrome)
        flags: # optional
        # Specify whether or not CI build should fail if Codecov runs into an error during upload

## Overview

- Pitch:

> A posting board for `users` to ask questions. While `devs` can answer the questions. Also, third role.
> `user-dev` can post questions or answer questions.

## Progress

- backend goals completed:
  - all roles able to sign up.
  - all roles able to sign in.
  - unanswered questions shown to logged in users.
  - a `user` || `user-dev` can ask a question.
  - a `dev` cannot ask a question.
  - a `dev` || `user-dev` can post an answer to question.
    - a `user` cannot answer a question.

- To GO:
  - all roles can read the answers posted on a question.

- future goals:
  - be able to mark a `user` question `solved`.
  - be able to mark a `devs` answer `best_answer`.
  - filter questions by `unanswered`, `solved`, or `all questions`, other options possible...
